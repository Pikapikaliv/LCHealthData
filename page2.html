                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-light pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">I asked those I interviewed what they believed were some strengths and weaknesses of the community that pertained to community resources, problems, transportation, values, attitudes, or environmental distracters to health. Although there were several people interviewed, these individuals displayed the most thorough answers that pinpointed several troublesome issues in the county as well as the best aspects about the county.</h3>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Strengths</strong>:&nbsp;I would say having a large addiction recovery presence in Lawrence county is our greatest strength. Unfortunately, the reason it has grown so fast is due to the overwhelming need of such facilities. I also believe the overall improvement in the  health of Lawrence county, is highly dependent on the assistance and success of addiction recovery care. This is a way for people in need to address the well being of their body, mind and spirit.<br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong>&nbsp;Lawrence County’s greatest weakness regarding health, in my opinion, is rooted in the “entitlement attitude”. People no longer value hard work or ambition. Our County and country has been crippled by the loss of value in hard work and the satisfaction and fulfillment of working for what you have. It has been replaced with entitlement. People feel entitled to “free” everything. They want to put zero effort into life, relationships, and family. People turn to drugs and alcohol to forget their problems for a while. What they don’t realize is they are only digging their pit of despair deeper. They are trying to fill a void that is created by the lack of vision for a better life. Whether that void is being filled with drugs, alcohol, or Little Debbie cakes and fast food, it has created a very unhealthy population in Lawrence County.</p>

                           Strengths</strong>:I think a strength would be that we have amazing people here that work in the healthcare industry and they truly care and become emotionally involved with their patients. To them you are not just a patient but a friend. For example, I can talk to my doctor and eye doctor anytime I need them they are only a message away from me. I had issues with my eye earlier this year and Elaine was there for me when I needed it anytime. And my Aunts doctor actually was a pallbearer at her funeral. You talk about taking the extra steps with a patient to literally carry them to their grave. 
<br>And I would add to this that when you are sick we have a community of people that show up and support us. They pray for us and bring us food or anything we need. My Aunt constantly had people bringing her food and taking her places.&nbsp;<br>So east Kentucky is just full of good people who love and take care of each other.<br><strong>Weaknesses</strong>:There is a Mayo Clinic study about how your attitude of whether your pessimistic or not will determine your life expectancy. In comparison to other areas, I think people in eastern Kentucky don’t believe in a long term life expectancy. They have this mindset that if you reach 60, you are old. In comparison to my friends in Florida, they think that’s incredibly young to die and they live into their 90's. This mindset takes away making wise long term decisions like choosing to eat healthy, exercise, and not smoking, which are all contributing factors to why people die at a younger age. </p>

                           Strengths</strong>:Our community seems to have a heart for helping others, with many Drives, such as for coats, socks, toys for kids, Thanksgiving  and Christmas baskets, Angel Tree gifts for children, donation boxes for the Humane Society, etc. Those are all wonderful ideas, that show where the organizers’ and donators’ hearts are.<br><strong>Weaknesses</strong>:&nbsp;However, a lot of people sadly take advantage of such good will...misrepresenting themselves to gain such things, or just reselling them for whatever reason.</p>
