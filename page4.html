                    <li><strong>Addiction - </strong>Drugs and alcohol are a crutch to many individuals in the community. &nbsp;Between the issue of poor awareness and minimal health education, addiction in the community has gotten out of control. &nbsp;Despite the health department's efforts to begin a Needle Exchange Program, there has been a big push to make the community work through the issue on its own. &nbsp;Local individuals are against the idea of helping addicts accomplish their goal in a safer manner. &nbsp;This lack of education about the issue is discouraging for healthcare providers in the area because of the growing issue of addiction.<br><strong>Problem Resolution</strong> - This problem can be helped with the proper public education; the health department can hold health fairs that provide information about the addiction problem in Lawrence County and how it can be helped. &nbsp;This may cause the public to see the positive aspects of the Needle Exchange Program. &nbsp;In addition, the Addiction Recovery Care (ARC) facility provides a Christian-based approach to leaving the path of addiction. &nbsp;This rehabilitation center is a good place for addicts to visit and seek help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Obesity &amp; Diabetes - </strong>Many local individuals are not well-educated in medical matters. &nbsp;Since this is the case, most people live the way they want and consume whatever they feel like eating. &nbsp;This disregard for a healthy lifestyle leads to weight problems and poor management of blood sugar. &nbsp;Since there are several fast food restaurants in the area and very few exercise opportunities, many individuals seek comfort in food and a sedentary lifestyle.<br><strong>Problem Resolution</strong> - Once again, the health department can hold health fairs that provide the public with information about obesity and diabetes. &nbsp;Local people need to be educated about how the usual sedentary lifestyle is harmful to their health and will lead to complications in the future. &nbsp;In addition, individuals should find a general practitioner that can discuss lifestyle changes to help improve their weight problem. &nbsp;Local gyms can be utilized to work off excess weight. &nbsp;Individuals can buy fresh food at a grocery store rather than at a restaurant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Hazards - </strong>Several locations in the county produce harmful waste or litter the surrounding areas. &nbsp;For example, many local tire yards burn tires rather than disposing of them in the proper manner; in addition, drug paraphernalia can be found in the streets of Louisa, which creates an unsafe environment for people to walk. &nbsp;These two hazards pose risks to many local peoples' health.<br><strong>Problem Resolution</strong> - Many of these problems can be solved with proper education and providing the right resources. &nbsp;The health department can provide much of this education to those who put pullutants into the air of the community. &nbsp;Recovery programs can be enforced to help the issue of addiction in the community. &nbsp;Once the education has been enforced, a group should volunteer to clean up the mess that has been left as a result of the previous lack of education. &nbsp;Needles must be cleared from the streets and tires should be disposed of properly. &nbsp;This will make the community healthier and safer.</li>
